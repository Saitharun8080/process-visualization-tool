## üíª Installation

To set up and run the Process Visualization Tool locally, follow these steps:

### üîß Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohanrao06/process-visualization-tool.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd process-visualization-tool
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    The application should open in your default browser.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it in the following ways:

1. **Select a Scheduling Algorithm** from the available options (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin).
2. **Enter Process Details** (process ID, burst time, arrival time, priority, etc.).
3. **Visualize the Scheduling Process** in real-time with Gantt charts and progress indicators.
4. **View System Monitoring Data**, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and top 5 resource-consuming processes.
5. **Adjust Parameters** like time quantum for Round Robin and observe the effect on scheduling.

## üìä Algorithms Supported

### 1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**

This is a simple scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive. While easy to implement, it may cause high waiting times for longer processes.

### 2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**

- **Non-Preemptive**: Processes with shorter burst times are executed first.
- **Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: A running process may be preempted by a new process with a shorter burst time.

### 3. **Priority Scheduling**

- **Non-Preemptive**: Processes are executed based on priority (lower numbers = higher priority).
- **Preemptive**: A new process with a higher priority can preempt the currently running process.

### 4. **Round Robin (RR)**

This is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is given a fixed time slice (quantum). If a process does not complete within this time, it is placed at the back of the queue for re-execution.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Monitoring

The **System Monitoring Dashboard** gives insights into the current state of your system:

- **Running Processes**: Displays active processes, their process IDs, and resource usage.
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time percentage of CPU being used.
- **Memory Usage**: Shows the memory consumption, both system-wide and for individual processes.
- **Storage Utilization**: A breakdown of storage usage across your disks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool allows you to configure various aspects of the scheduling algorithms, such as:

- **Time Quantum**: Configurable for Round Robin scheduling.
- **Process Details**: Customize process IDs, burst times, arrival times, and priorities.
- **Visualization Options**: Customize Gantt chart colors and layouts for better understanding.

These settings can be easily adjusted through the user interface provided by Streamlit.
